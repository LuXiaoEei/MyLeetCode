# 部门最高工资

Employee 表有所有员工。 每个员工有 Id, salary 和 department Id 信息。

Department 表有公司的所有部门。

用 SQL查询语句找出每个部门工资最高的员工。如下，Max在IT部门有最高工资，Henry在Sales部门有最高工资。

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select C.Name as Department,A.Name as Employee,B.M as Salary  from Employee A,
    (select DepartmentId ,max(Salary) as M from Employee group by DepartmentId ) B,
    Department C
    where A.DepartmentId=B.DepartmentId and A.Salary=B.M and A.DepartmentId=C.Id
```
