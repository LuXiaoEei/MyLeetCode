# Clone Graph

深层复制一张图

```
OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
```

dfs，注意标记已经复制过邻域的点，如果复制过，这个节点直接引用，所以marked键是节点的label，值是节点整体

```py
# Definition for a undirected graph node
# class UndirectedGraphNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.label = x
#         self.neighbors = []

class Solution:
    # @param node, a undirected graph node
    # @return a undirected graph node
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        def dfs(node):
            neigh=node.neighbors
            res=[]
            for item in neigh:
                if not marked.get(item.label):
                    tmp=UndirectedGraphNode(item.label)
                    marked[item.label]=tmp
                    tmp.neighbors = dfs(item)                    
                else:
                    tmp=marked[item.label]
                res.append(tmp)
            return res
        
        if node is None:
            return 
        marked={}
        Tree=UndirectedGraphNode(node.label)
        marked[node.label]=Tree
        Tree.neighbors=dfs(node)
        return Tree    
```
